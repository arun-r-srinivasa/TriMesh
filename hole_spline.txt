# 2-D boundary description
# "#" is the comment line signal
# go ccw for externl and CW for internal boundaries
#*LOOP represents a new boundary curve. 
#each segement has Number of points
#points x,y,x,y,x,y etc 
#*END is the end of the file
*LOOP

# Polygonal Line:  the syntax is POLYLINE, x1, y1, distance between points, x2, y2, ... if the last is the same as the first it is a closed loop
#*LOOP
#CIRCLE,0.07, 0,-0.75,0.5,360,0
# Circular arc: syntax is  CIRCLE, distance between points , center_x, center_y, radius, start angle(deg), end angle(deg) 
# cw verssus ccw is decided by start and end angles.

# spline interterpolation: syntax is  number of points, location of knots (final point= initial poinf for smooth curve 

*REFINEMENT_REGIONS
# this is for mesh refinement  THE FIRST ONE IS THE BOUNDING BOX AND IT HAS TO BE THERE

# the first one has to be a BOUNDING BOK or curve that contains the whole figure, THis is what controls how to ditribute the points 
# sytax is the same as for LOOP except that there is a level indicator for nesting (level 1 = outer level level 2 is a subset of the region enclosed by level 1 etc.
